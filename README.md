In this game, you have 9 blocks in total: 8 are numbered from 1 to 8, and one is an empty block used for moving the numbered blocks. Your goal is to arrange all the blocks in sequential order from 1 to 8 by using the empty block to switch positions with the other blocks.

Here's how to play:

Objective: Arrange the blocks in numerical order, leaving the empty block at the end.
Selecting the Empty Block: Move the black pointer over the empty block using your hand movements. To grab the empty block, decrease the gap between the first three fingers of your right hand.
Moving Blocks: Once you have grabbed the empty block, you can move it to any adjacent block. To release and swap the empty block with a numbered block, increase the gap between the first three fingers of your right hand.
Swapping: Continue grabbing and releasing the empty block to swap it with numbered blocks until all blocks are in the correct order.
Use the hand detection feature to control the pointer, leveraging OpenCV's tracking capabilities to interact with the blocks. Arrange all the blocks correctly to win the game.
